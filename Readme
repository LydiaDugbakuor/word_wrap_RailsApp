Word Wrap Project
This is a simple application based on Rails framework to wrap a string passed by the user based on a column number that user supplies.

Environment for Development
Created an environment on AWS Cloud9 for development

1. Controller: /word_wrap_app/app/controllers/wrappers_controller.rb
In the controller, I defined my 'show' action which picks the values entered in the form and then supplies that to the method defiend in the model for wrapping 

2. Model: /word_wrap_app/app/models/wrapper.rb
The app does not have any backend database but a model class was created where I defined the method to perform the wrapping 

3. View: /word_wrap_app/app/views/wrappers/show.html.erb
A form was  created in this file 

4. Route: /word_wrap_app/app/config/routes.rb
The routes were put here. The form was posting data back to the same page. So the route does both the GET and POST methods 

5. CSS: /word_wrap_app/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
The form was styled using simple css styling in this file

6. Server: /word_wrap_app/app/config/environments/development.rb
This file was edited to add connection to the local server.
